# Check-In and -Out

<!---
I will hide the keys outside the apartment and will let you know the location in a private message. That way, you can enter independently. If there are any problems, you can ring the bell of my neighbours (for example Trudy on number 10) or call my sister Carlijn (+31631144027) who also lives in Utrecht. On the day of check-out, you can stay in the apartment until around 15:00. Let me know if you need to stay longer. When you leave, please put the keys back in the same hiding spot.

I will meet you at my apartment to hand over the keys for the check-in. Simply ring the bell at number 8. On the day of check-out, you can stay in the apartment until around 15:00. Let me know if you need to stay longer. When you leave, please throw the keys in my mailbox.

# Toilet (!)

The button of the toilet sometimes gets stuck if you press too hard. When you pull the plastic cover towards you a bit, as in the first photo, the button should release again.

![Toilet](./images/Toilet.jpg)

Toilet paper can be found in the closet behind the toilet.

# Coffee and Tea

Feel free to use the Nespresso coffee machine or the kettle to make tea. I will leave milk for the coffee in the fridge. Any other food and drinks in the apartment are my personal items and not intended for guests.

# Cleaning

It’s not necessary to clean my apartment extensively before you leave. I will clean when I get back home. But if you need anything, there is cleaning equipment in the cupboard.

# Trash

Utrecht separates paper and glass from all other trash. Regular trash goes in the left big bin, paper and cardboard goes in the right big bin.

![Trash](./images/Trash.jpg)

Glass goes in the small bin.

# Heating

The heating automatically follows a programme which sets the temperature at 20° between 8:30-10:00 and between 17:00-23:00. It is 17.5° during the other times. If you want to change the temperature, the easiest way is to use the small arrows.

# Washing and Drying

 - [Washer manual](./manuals/Washing Machine.pdf)
 - [Dryer manual](./manuals/Dryer.pdf)

Feel free to use the washing machine and the dryer. There is also detergent and an iron. The default programme “Katoen” is usually the best one and takes 1:36 hours to complete.

![Washing Machine](./images/Washing Machine.jpg)

The default programme of the dryer is usually the best one and takes a maximum of 1:25 hours to complete but shorter if it senses that the clothes are dry.

# Oven and Microwave

 - [Oven and microwave manual](./manuals/Oven and Microwave.pdf)

The oven and microwave are the same machine. The easiest way to start the microwave is simply to press the ‘play’ button.

![Oven](./images/Oven.jpg)

# Dishwasher

 - [Dishwasher manual](./manuals/Dishwasher.pdf)

There is no need to clean your dishes during your stay. You can simply place them in the sink or inside the dishwasher. I will turn on the dishwasher when I get back home. If you need it, the default programme “P1” is the best option and you can get a dishwasher tablet from the drawer on the right.

# WiFi

For internet, select the WiFi named 'KrommerijnGuests'. I will send you the password in a private message.

# Train Stations

There are two train stations nearby; Utrecht Centraal is about a [20 minute walk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WKPyBg3GZ6s4Kenx7) and Utrecht Vaartsche Rijn is only a [5 minute walk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dtb1sXQgPfhBtdkA7). From Vaartsche Rijn, you can take a 'sprinter' train to Utrecht Centraal but there is also a tram and bus service towards the main train station.

# Parking

There is parking right in front of the building, but I cannot guarantee that there is always a spot available. You can park anywhere in the area, though the price changes per neighbourhood. The prices per hour for each neighboorhood can be seen on this [map](https://gu-geo.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=365c7b6926f74660b7322e646e8548dc). More information about parking in Utrecht can be found on the [website](https://www.utrecht.nl/wonen-en-leven/parkeren/parkeerkosten) of the city.

# Supermarket

The closest supermarket is Jumbo, which is just a few minutes walking: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/WCgqFtuvvzDRpsMG9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WCgqFtuvvzDRpsMG9)

# Bars and Restaurants

There are many bars and restaurants everywhere in Utrecht, but the two main areas are around a place called ‘Neude’ in the north and around ‘Ledig Erf’ in the south, as highlighted on the map.
